For example:

five(four(three(two(one()))))
We can make easier sense of it using the |> operator by treating the nested calls more sequentially by “unwrapping” them and linking them in a series with the pipe operator:

one() |> two() |> three() |> four() |> five()
The pipe operator takes the result on the left, and passes it to the right hand side.
